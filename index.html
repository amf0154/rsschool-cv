    <h2>My story</h2>
    <article>
      <p>Let me talk about myself. I started learning to code at 24 years. I've learned Pascal, Java and Php in university. My diploma project had been writen with php, it was a flower shop project for costumer from Russia.</p> 
      <p>After university i was working as a system administrator for about 2 years. But this work didn't get me enough pleasure, it was interesting when i was writting different shell scrypts and was busy with other work related with programming only. Meanwhile I started learning MEAN stack, i wrote some simple application after it and got one important thing - programming is really interesting cool thing, and i really wanna dedicate myself for it.</p>
      <p>Now, i've been working as a fullstack developer, but i know exactly - i don't have enough knowledges and good skill, i have to get it and work in serious IT company such as EPAM for example, that's why i have to finish these courses :) </p>
      <p>In my spare time i like to watch YouTube, repair electronic stuffs, go to gym and hung out with my friends. Also i like to read interesting articles from Medium.com , there are a lot of usefull documentation about programming and much interesting information about everything. I wanna write any personal article on this site (of course in English).</p>
